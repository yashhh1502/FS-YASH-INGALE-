🚗 Student Commute Optimizer
A carpooling and route-sharing application designed for students. Instead of commuting individually, students can share rides efficiently by matching with others traveling along similar routes.


📌 Problem Statement
Many students travel individually to schools/colleges, leading to:
Higher travel costs
Increased traffic congestion
Environmental pollution
Missed opportunities for social interaction


💡 Proposed Solution
The Student Commute Optimizer helps students:
Enter their home location and destination.
Visualize their route on a map.
Find nearby students traveling in the same direction.
Chat with students using anonymous usernames (e.g., Student_123).
Coordinate carpooling / ride-sharing safely.
